Arm Mbed DAPLink is an open-source software which enables debugging application software. Commonly referred to as interface firmware, DAPLink runs on a secondary MCU attached to the SWD or JTAG port of the application MCU found on nearly all development boards. It creates a bridge between your development computer and the CPU debug access port. DAPLink enables developers with drag-and-drop programming, a serial port and CMSIS-DAP based debugging.

Over the years DAPLink has been widely adopted and embedded into microcontroller development boards. We've been making many improvements to DAPLink from the kernel to USB stack and the implementation of a virtual filesystem. This includes robust protections in the bootloader to prevent the MCU from getting corrupted by unexpected SCSI command sequences in mass storage class data transfers. We've now made it possible to get these updates on all development boards that run DAPLink interface firmware or have a DAPLink compatible MCU circuit.
